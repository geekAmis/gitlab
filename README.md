## What is it?

This is a bot for new, private telegram groups, which will process new user requests by testing. The user will answer the questions hidden in the database, all the answers will be taken into account and entered into the database, and after passing the test, the administrator will be able to accept or reject the application to the group

## Configuration
I do not hide my telegram token, so I have defined it in a separate file, but you can use other methods.

To install your token in the original version, a file is used config.py , where the admin id and token bot are located

## Start

### Linux:
<code>python3 main.py</code>

### Windows:
<code>python main.py</code>
